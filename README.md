Honours Project
===============

A minimal [matrix](matrix.org) homeserver implemented in Erlang. The implementation focuses on scalability and fault-tolerance. As a result, only a minimal number of endpoints from the matrix [client-server API](https://spec.matrix.org/latest/client-server-api/) was implemented to allow for basic room participation.

Matrix is an instant-messaging, VoIP and IoT communication Protocol that has federation, security and openness at its core.

This Project was carried out in the context of my honours project at the University of Dundee.
